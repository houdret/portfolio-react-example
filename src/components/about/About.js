                <p>  With a vested passion for various fields such as programming and 3D, I'm currently following a bootcamp at BeCode.org. This allows me to polish my skills in JS, PHP, CSS, Saas in addition to frameworks like React.js, Vue.js and React-Native. Which makes me think I'd like to get started with other frameworks and 3D-oriented tools, of which Three.js, 3Dmax and zbrush.
